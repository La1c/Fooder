# Fooder

Main project at VK University.

Get a grocery list from recipes you like! 

Current status:
 * Details screen design is finished (but who knows)
 * You can add new groceries from recipes
 * You can check items you've bought
 * Search within categories
 * Recipes you wanted to cook are right at grocery list screen
 * User can choose intolerances in settings (e.g. one has peanut allergy), recipes with such products will be omited from search results

TO-DO:

* Flexible search (search works, but I want make it "live" and enable food type change) -- probably no
* Cuisine and diet search?
* Favorites / Cooked screen
* Sharing (VK, Telegram)
* A lot of different stuff to make this app better
